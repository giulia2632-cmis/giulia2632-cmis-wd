These are the steps that will leave you with a new file called "file.txt" in your github respository by the end of class:
1. After coming on to your computer, log in on everything including github.
2. Then clone. Your command should look like this:git clone --config="http.proxy=http://giulia2632:giulia2632@192.168.2.1:8080" https://github.com/giulia2632-cmis/giulia2632-cmis-wd.git
But with your username in it.
3. To create the gedit file for "file.txt", you must type in the command: gedit <file name>
In this case the file name is file.txt so the command would be: 
gedit file.txt (If you want to use terminal and gedit at the same time, add an &)example: gedit file.txt &
4. After doing this, your gedit file that is already named file.txt should pop up. Then, type what ever you want into the file and save it.
5. When you are done or you want to save your work for now, use the command: git add <file name> 
So it would be: git add file.txt
